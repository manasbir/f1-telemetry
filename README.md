# F1 DRS Effectiveness
This project was created for my grade 12 physics lab (that's why the code is poorly written haha). 

## How it Works
 - Get data of fastest qualifying lap of each driver and group via car
 - Sift through data by ensuring high rpm, positive acceleration, etc.
 - Seperate with DRS and no DRS
 - Physics...
 - proft
