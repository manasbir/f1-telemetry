# F1 DRS Effectiveness
This project was created for my grade 12 physics lab. I would attach the report, but I don't think I can do that (IB rules). DM me if you want the report.
Grade 22/24 - 7/7 

## How it Works
 - Get data of fastest qualifying lap of each driver and group via car
 - Sift through data by ensuring high rpm, positive acceleration, etc.
 - Seperate with DRS and no DRS
 - Physics...
 - proft
